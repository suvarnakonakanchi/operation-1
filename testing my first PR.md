i learned what an IP address is - it is like a digital address for the laptop which helps websites know where to send info.(like the address on the post helps the post man to know where to deliver).
it is of two different types public(ex:clg) and private(can be used only in the within that network eg:home and hostel)
i tried with different net works like mobile hotspot and hostel wifi . Each time ,my ip address changed and it is because eack network gives my laptop a new address.


a network is just a group of devices connected so they can share things.phone, laptop, and printer all talking to each other. It’s a small network. On a larger scale, networks connect entire offices, cities, or even countries. Without networks, every device would be isolated—no file sharing, no email, no browsing.

LAN (Local Area Network) is the small, close-knit version of a network.When we connect our phone to WiFi at home, you’re joining our home LAN. In a LAN, devices can share printers, files, and most importantly, the Internet connection. LANs are usually fast because everything is close by—like chatting with someone in the same room rather than shouting across a city.

A router is a networking device whose job is to direct data packets between different networks. It connects at least two networks.the router includes 3 tyoes of function,
Packet forwarding = post office delivering your letters (data packets).
Routing tables = the map that shows the best path.
Router role = your home’s gateway that connects your local network (LAN) to the outside Internet (WAN).

The Internet is often described as a “network of networks,” and that’s exactly what it is. Billions of devices are linked together through millions of smaller networks, all connected by routers.
for example,when we open the website
our device makes a request. our laptop asks, “Can I visit this website?” and sends the message through our LAN to the router.
The router talks to our ISP. our Internet Service Provider (like Airtel, Jio, BSNL, etc.) takes our request and passes it along its own larger network.
Hops across routers. our data travels across several routers, kind of like passing through checkpoints, each one pushing it closer to the website’s server.
The server responds. The website’s server (say YouTube’s data center) gets the request, prepares the page or video, and sends it back along the same kind of path.
we will see the result. Within seconds—or even milliseconds—the content appears on our screen.
